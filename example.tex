% The \documentclass{} macro specifies the overall style. For computer
% networking papers, common options are:
%
%   \documentclass[twocolumn,a4paper]{article}  % Base LaTeX style
%   \documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}        % IEEE Conference
%   \documentclass[10pt,sigconf]{acmart}        % ACM SIGCOMM conference

% The following packages are recommended, and should be available in most
% standard LaTeX installations (or from https://www.ctan.org/). Note that 
% the order in which packages are loaded is significant.

% Basic extensions recommended for all LaTeX documents:
%   nag        Warn about common problems with LaTeX files

% The AMS mathematics library greatly extends and improves mathematics
% support in LaTeX (see http://ctan.org/pkg/amsmath for details). When
%  preparing multi-line numbered equations, be sure to use:
%
%   \begin{align}
%     ...
%   \end{align} 
%
% rather than:
%
%   \begin{eqnarray}
%     ...
%   \end{eqnarray}.  
%
% when this package is loaded, to ensure they formatting is consistent
% (see https://tug.org/pracjourn/2006-4/madsen/madsen.pdf for details).

\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage[all]{onlyamsmath}

% Use Times, Helvetica, and Courier fonts, rather than Computer Modern:

\makeatletter
\@ifclassloaded{acmart}{
  % The ACM article style sets the fonts internally
}{
  \usepackage{newtxtext}
  \usepackage{newtxmath}
}
\makeatother

% Add support for sub-figures within a figure, as follows:
%
%   \begin{figure}
%     \centering
%     \subfloat[caption for 1st subfloat]{
%       \includegraphics{...}
%       \label{...}
%     }
%     \\
%     \subfloat[caption for 2nd subfloat]{
%       \includegraphics{...}
%       \label{...}
%     }
%     \caption{caption for entire figure}
%     \label{...}
%   \end{figure*}
%
% The subfig package obsoletes the older subfigure package, and is itself
% deprecated in favour of the subcaption package. However, as of April 2015
% subcaption doesn't work with ACM or IEEE style files (this is also the
% reason for the [caption=false] option).

\usepackage[caption=false]{subfig}

% Improve formatting of tables. To produce nice looking tables:
%
%   - avoid vertical lines;
%   - avoid double horizontal lines;
%   - use horizontal lines above and below the table, and to separate the
%     header from the body of the table, but not elsewhere; and
%   - if in doubt, align columns to the left (columns of numbers should
%     align to the decimal point)
%
% This translates to a tabular environment that looks something like the
% following:
%
%   \begin{tabular}{lll}
%     \toprule
%        Header1 & Header2 & Header3 \\
%     \midrule
%        Line1   & ...     & ...     \\
%        Line2   & ...     & ...     \\
%        Line3   & ...     & ...     \\
%        Line4   & ...     & ...     \\
%     \bottomrule
%   \end{tabular}

\usepackage{booktabs}

% Improve formatting for quote marks in verbatim mode:
\usepackage{upquote}

% Improve support for graphics:
\usepackage{graphicx}

% Add support for URLs using \url{...}. This formats the URL in typewriter
% font, and makes it a hyperlink if the hyperref package is also loaded.
\usepackage{url}

% Add support for drawing packet headers. For instructions, see
% http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/bytefield
\usepackage{bytefield}

% Add support for typesetting program source code. You can either include
% code in-line:
%
%   \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
%   Source code goes here
%   \end{lstlisting}
%
% or include a source file:
%
%  \lstinputlisting[language=Python]{source_filename.py}
%
% This package is highly customisable and supports a range of languages.
% See package documentation at https://ctan.org/pkg/listings for details.
\usepackage{listings}

% Generated PDF files can include hyperlinks for URLs and cross-references
% using the hyperref package. This package, however, can interact poorly
% with others. Known issues include:
%
%  - Papers typeset without page numbers gives warnings of the form:
%      "pdfTeX warning (ext4): destination with the same identifier 
%      (name{page.}) has been already used, duplicate ignored".
%    since hyperref tries to refer to the page number.
%  - The algorithmic package uses the same line-numbering scheme for each
%    algorithm, and can cause duplicate identifier warnings if you have
%    several algorithms with line numbers (this may have been fixed with 
%    recent versions of algorithmic...).
%  - If using the algorithm package with hyperref, you need to load packages
%    in the following order (see README in hyperref documentation):
%      \usepackage{float}
%      \usepackage{hyperref}
%      \usepackage{algorithm}
% For these reasons, hyperref is best to avoid for most papers, however if
% needed, uncomment the following two lines:
%  \usepackage{float}
%  \usepackage{hyperref}

% The algorithm package defines the algorithm environment. This is used in
% the same way as the figure and table environments, to include algorithms
% in a paper. The algpseudocode package provides the ability to typeset the
% algorithms: http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx
\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algpseudocode}
\usepackage{color}

% By default, LaTeX adds extra space after punctuation. The \frenchspacing
% command disables this. This creates tighter looking, more even, text and
% avoids inconsistencies if you forget to use '\ ' to suppress the spacing
% after in-sentence punctuation.
\frenchspacing

% Prevent hyphenation of all upper case words:
\uchyph=0

% The ACM style needs \maketitle after the abstract, but the other styles
% want it before; these macros hide the difference and are used below:
\makeatletter
\@ifclassloaded{acmart}{
  \newcommand{\maketitleSTD}{}
  \newcommand{\maketitleACM}{\maketitle}
}{
  \newcommand{\maketitleSTD}{\maketitle}
  \newcommand{\maketitleACM}{}
}
\makeatother

\section{Introduction}

% A good paper introduction is fairly formulaic. If you follow a simple set
% of rules, you can write a very good introduction. The following outline can
% be varied. For example, you can use two paragraphs instead of one, or you
% can place more emphasis on one aspect of the intro than another. But in all
% cases, all of the points below need to be covered in an introduction, and
% in most papers, you don't need to cover anything more in an introduction.
%
% Paragraph 1: Motivation. At a high level, what is the problem area you
% are working in and why is it important? It is important to set the larger
% context here. Why is the problem of interest and importance to the larger
% community?

Since its introduction in 2012, QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) has been a big area of interest for internet researchers and engineers. What initially started as a Google's own transport solution, described by Roskind in its original draft \cite{QUIC-origin} has become a protocol of interest for many reputable internet bodies, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF. They formed the IETF-quic group in late 2016 in an attempt to standartize the protocol, which resulted in major changes, including a name request amendment submitted in late 2018, changing QUIC to HTTP/3.

% Paragraph 2: What is the specific problem considered in this paper? This
% paragraph narrows down the topic area of the paper. In the first
% paragraph you have established general context and importance. Here you
% establish specific context and background.

Despite the big research interest, not many measurement tests were done to showcase QUIC's reachability. For example, we have seen Google's quic developer report 93\% reachability of the protocol which rose to 95\% reachability in the tech giant's SIGCOMM '17 paper \cite{ACM-Quic-Google}. Other than Google's own reports, we do not work, targeting the reachability. \todo{Check this statement's corectness (On a first glance I've not been able to find other figures, but perhaps CSP or SQ might know better)}. Providing such information would be benefitial for the comunity in the sense that we can make a strong argument about the future success of the protocol and we can reason whether it would be an appropriate alternative of its competitors on the network we have right now. Furthermore, it would be interesting to see if there are some middleboxes that allow QUIC traffic, when it originates from one of Google's servers. I.e. would the percentage reported by the Google team remain similar or would more middleboxes block QUIC when it is coming from an unknown origin, making the reported number go down.

% Paragraph 3: "In this paper, we show that...". This is the key paragraph
% in the introduction - you summarize, in one paragraph, what are the main
% contributions of your paper, given the context established in paragraphs 
% 1 and 2. What's the general approach taken? Why are the specific results
% significant? The story is not what you did, but rather:
%  - what you show, new ideas, new insights
%  - why interesting, important?
% State your contributions: these drive the entire paper.  Contributions
% should be refutable claims, not vague generic statements.

\todo{Describe the experiment(s) and summarize the findings that follow from it}
In this paper, we show that ... , using a hosted server which serves \todo{Specific QUIC and UDP elements}.



% Paragraph 4: What are the differences between your work, and what others
% have done? Keep this at a high level, as you can refer to future sections
% where specific details and differences will be given, but it is important
% for the reader to know what is new about this work compared to other work
% in the area.

\todo{Quote and relate to other UDP/Quic measurement works. ECN over UDP could be one. A first look of Quic in the wild https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05168 (accepted at PAM '18). Taking a long look at QUIC SIGCOMM ' 17}

% Paragraph 5: "We structure the remainder of this paper as follows." Give
% the reader a road-map for the rest of the paper. Try to avoid redundant
% phrasing, "In Section 2, In section 3, ..., In Section 4, ... ", etc.

We structure the remainder of this paper as follows, section 2 presents the design of our experiment, Section 3 presents our evaluation and results, Section 4 provides a discussion, following from the experimental results, Section 5 outlines related work and finally, section 6 concludes the document.

%==================================================================================================
% Concentrate single-mindedly on a narrative that:
%  - Describes the problem, and why it's interesting
%  - Describes your idea
%  - Defends your idea, showing how it solves the problem, and filling out
%    the details
% On the way, cite relevant work in passing, but defer discussion to the
% end.
%
% Introduce the problem, and your idea, using examples, and only then
% present the general case. Explain the idea as if your were speaking to
% someone using a whiteboard. Conveying the intuition is primary; details
% follow. Write in a top down manner: state broad themes and ideas first,
% then go into details.
%
% The introduction makes claims. The body of the paper provides evidence
% to support each claim. Check each claim in the introduction, identify
% the evidence, and forward-reference it from the claim. 
%==================================================================================================
\section{Experimental Setup}

Ok, so far I see this being done as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Setup a Server which will host a single page to be loaded
    \item Load a resource (image perhaps) using QUIC - might need some more research on how this can be done
    \item Fetch data using WebRTC (perhaps a video hosted on the server) in order to test UDP reachability in case QUIC fails and would be nice if we find some correlation
    \item Use JS to send feedback for which item loaded successfully
\end{itemize}

% The problem



%==================================================================================================
\section{Evaluation}

% My idea



%==================================================================================================
\section{Discussion}

% The details

% Describe results carefully:
%  - clearly state assumptions
%  - give enough information to allow the reader to recreate the results
%  - ensure results are representative; statistically meaningful, etc.
%  - don't overstate results
%  - equally, don't understate them: consider the broader implications



%==================================================================================================
\section{Related Work}

% This should come near the end, and focussing on discussing how your work
% relates to that of others. Any relevant related work should have been
% cited already, so this is not a list of related work, it's a discussion
% of how that work relates.
%
% Why not put related work after the introduction? 1) because describing
% alternative approaches gets between the reader and your idea; and 2)
% because the reader knows nothing about the problem yet, so your
% (carefully trimmed) description of various technical trade-offs is
% absolutely incomprehensible.
% 
% When writing the related work:
%  - Give credit to others where it's due; this doesn't diminish the
%    credit you get from your paper. 
%  - Acknowledge weaknesses in your approach.
%  - Ensure related work is accurate and up-to-date
